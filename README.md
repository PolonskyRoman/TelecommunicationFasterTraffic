Telecommunication faster traffic. Instead SSL (Let's encrypt - protocol 443 which I had twice :-)...for example)

# Algorithm A
row := (b1, ..., bn)
cube := (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

Throw the cube if ||row|| > 0:
  Insert i to llb(i)
  OR
  Insert to:
    n - len(chosenN) to llb(i)
    OR
    n-len(row)*len(col)*len(h) to llb(i)
  Repeat
 
 # Algorithms B (one, two, three from previous Algorithm A)
 Foreach (one, two, three) in llb(i):
  if not full ROWS/COLS/HIGHET full it
  
 # IT IS NOT FULL ALGORITHM - CHALLENGE IF YOU CAN GUESS EVEN HOW IT WORK (IN THE END IT WILL RETURN YOU ID THAT WILL KNOW HOW TO f^(-1) IT BACK TO ORIGINAL).
 # I JUST DRAW IT SO MAX LATER WILL FINISH IT :-)
